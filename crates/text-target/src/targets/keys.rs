//! Tier 3: synthetic keystrokes. Stubs.
//!
//! Typing the text key by key works in anything that takes keyboard focus,
//! which is why every dictation tool ships it. It is also the worst tier:
//! insert-only, layout-dependent (a synthetic `KeyA` produces whatever the
//! active layout maps it to), and slow enough per event that long insertions
//! visibly stream. Characters with no key on the current layout need a
//! per-platform unicode path, noted per target below.

/// macOS CGEvent keyboard synthesis. Stub.
///
/// Needs: `CGEventCreateKeyboardEvent` plus
/// `CGEventKeyboardSetUnicodeString`, which sidesteps layouts entirely by
/// attaching the literal string to a single event pair, and the same
/// Accessibility trust the AX tier needs. When AX trust exists the AX tier
/// is strictly better, so on macOS this only matters for apps that take
/// keys but expose no AX field, which is exactly the secure-input and
/// game-window cases where synthesis is often blocked too.
